Potential Improvements

User Experience

Loading States: Add loading indicators when fetching data or during transitions to provide visual feedback to users.
Error Handling: Implement more robust error handling for network requests, especially for the HelloAsso integration.
Accessibility: Improve accessibility by adding proper ARIA attributes, ensuring sufficient color contrast, and making interactive elements keyboard navigable.
Responsive Design: Ensure the app works well on various screen sizes, particularly on tablets and larger screens.
Offline Support: Add basic offline functionality to allow users to view cached content when not connected.

Functionality

Map Interaction: Enhance the map functionality with more interactive features, possibly using a mapping library for a more realistic experience.
Event Filtering: Add more advanced filtering options for events, such as by time or location.
User Preferences: Implement a settings page to allow users to customize their experience.
Calendar Integration: Add the ability to add events to the user's calendar.
Notifications: Implement push notifications for upcoming events or important updates.

Code Structure

State Management: Consider using a more robust state management solution like React Context or Redux for managing application state.
Code Splitting: Implement code splitting to reduce the initial bundle size and improve load times.
TypeScript Enhancements: Strengthen type definitions and interfaces for better type safety.
Testing: Add unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
API Layer: Create a dedicated API layer for handling external data fetching and manipulation.

Performance

Image Optimization: Optimize images further for faster loading, possibly implementing lazy loading.
Caching Strategy: Implement a more sophisticated caching strategy for frequently accessed data.
Component Memoization: Use React.memo and useCallback/useMemo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
Bundle Size: Analyze and reduce the bundle size by removing unused dependencies.

Design

Design System: Formalize the design system with consistent spacing, typography, and color usage.
Animations: Add subtle animations for transitions to enhance the user experience.
Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode option for users who prefer it.
Visual Hierarchy: Improve visual hierarchy to better guide users through the content.
